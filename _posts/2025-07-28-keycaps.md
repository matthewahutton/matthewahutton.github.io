## This page is a work in progress! Up early for testing purposes :)

# Background

3D printing keycaps on an FDM printer is an ongoing area of interest for many. 
Some seem to have found success by using 0.2mm nozzles, tiny layer heights, and lots of support ([https://candrews.integralblue.com/2024/03/3d-printing-high-quality-keycaps/](see: 3D Printing High Quality Keycaps, Craig Andrews)).
I like Craigs article, and it's inspired me to have a crack at this myself. 

# Goals

There are some things that I'd like to achieve for this project. 

Short term:
- Minimise post processing (should be printable without support)
- Should use 0.4mm nozzle 
- Apply to any keycap profile
- Should work with standard and box style stems
- 

# Approach

Start by not using the OpenSCAD library, going to start with my own design. 
No stem modelling - use slicer to generate structure from wall loops.
Non-planar ironing implimentation for surface finish.
0% infill globally and a height range modifier for above xmm to entail stem support.
