Who am I? 
======

Hello, I'm Matt. I'm (as of writing) a third year mechanical engineering student. 
This website is going to act as my portfolio and project repository. 

Why a website?
----- 

Lately it had become obvious that I need to start writing down what I do! 
For one I need to keep track of my projects in a bit more of a committed way. 
And some of these projects might even contain useful information for your projects, so I want it to be "googleable".

That's all for now!
Stay tuned.
