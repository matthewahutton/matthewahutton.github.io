# Background

Gladiolus are a beautiful long flower. 
For the most part they can grow year round here in South East Queensland, given enough irrigation. 
Typically, the only gap in the growing season comes when our southern neighbors short season starts and they flood the market.

Glads are graded by length - the longer the better.
We use an old dutch rose grading machine. 
Unfortunately, parts are becoming hard to come by and very expensive. 
The part I'm replicating today costs around $80 from the only supplier.



# Design

## Requirements

![The original parts](/images/flowergrader/Original%20parts.jpg)

The original parts are of solid white nylon construction.
Visual inspection indicated they are likely laser cut then post machined. 

The aim of this project is to replicate the function of these parts as closely as possible. 

## Modelling 



# Prototype

## Print Settings

## PLA part for test fitting

## PETG Production part
