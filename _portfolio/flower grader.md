# Background

Gladiolus are a beautiful long flower. 
For the most part they can grow year round here in South East Queensland, given enough irrigation. 
Typically, the only gap in the growing season comes when our southern neighbors short season starts and they flood the market.



- Machine is long out of production so parts are hard to come by
- There is only one supplier, who are in the netherlands
- While well made, these parts are very expensive 
- 

# Design

## Requirements

![The original parts](/images/flowergrader/Original%20parts.jpg)

The original parts are of solid white nylon construction.
Visual inspection indicated they are likey laser cut then post machined. 

The aim of this project is to replicate the function of these parts as closely as possible. 

## Modelling 



# Prototype

A smaller prototype 

## Print Settings
